<h1>ABOUT US </h1>

<p>As freshmen and transfer students, we realize that it was not easy to make friends with similar interest. Most students in Cal Poly Pomona commute to campus so it was more difficult to gather students to meet.
  We noticed that other students mentioned it as well, so we decided to create a chat room for Cal Poly Pomona students. We want students to easily make friends and start clubs to obtain the college experience. Everyone
  knows that meeting people is easy, but making friends is not. So if you are a freshmen or transfer student, jump on Bronco-Chat and make some friends! </p>
