			<p>For most freshmen and transfer students, it is easy to meet people, but it is difficult to find people with similar
			 interest, especially in a commuter school.  Cal Poly Pomona is considered a commuter school, which means students leave
			  campus after they are finish with classes. Bronco Chat changes that around. Bronco Chat was built to help students to
			  find people with similar interest. Students no longer have to struggle making friends. They can easily login into Bronco
			  Chat and make friends in a click away!</p>
